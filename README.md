Everything in JavaScript is referred to as an object {real-life entities}.
It is a synchronous (blocking code), single-threaded language, meaning it executes code in a sequential manner and operates with a single unit of execution.
JavaScript comes with 2 different runtime environments in the context of the Node environment or the browser.

When we are dealing with a database or file system, both events are happening, so to handle such events, we need to use both synchronous and asynchronous functions for execution.
