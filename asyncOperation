Callback : promise : Await are the 3 term which is use for the asynchronous operation/ action  in javascript .

Callback function : 

Calling the other function as a argument in main or parent function in javascript.


Synchronous function : the function which is running out in a linear fasion or maintaing some order or some sequence queue to run the particular line of code or block and functions of code .

Running the single process or thread at a time.

Suppose i have 3 function like 

Fun 1(){}
Fun 2 (){}
Fun 3() {}

Then the fun 1 will execute first  
The next function fun2 will execute after that fun3 ok .


Asynchronous function :
The function which are not maintaining the sequence queue to run the particular line of code or block and function of code.

Running the multipe process or thread at a time.

Let's take same example 
Fun 1{
Taking 1sec time  for execution }

Fun 2{
Taking 2sec time for execution 
}
Fun3 {
Taking 3sec time for execution
  }

Now here fun 1 {} will execute only till the waiting period of 2sec 
Then fun 2 {}
Will run till the waiting period of 3sec of time window 
Then fun 3{} finally will see in our list.


This is one type of async operation or action in js or server which is handling with the help of 

Callback or promise or await function in js .


Let's the other function wait for the execution of main  function.


Promise :
Promise is nothing but it's used to handle the asynchronous operation or action.
And find out the whether the called function is completed or still present in pending  state. Means to check the status of calling function which is successfully completed or rejected.


It's having three state 

Pending 
Fulfilled
Rejected.

.then ()
This callback 
Method is used to resolve the full filled state of promise.

. catch () this callback 
Method is used to resolve the  rejected state of promise.


. finnally () block method is used to resolve the status of either full filled or rejected promise .
